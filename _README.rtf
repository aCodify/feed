These are the php build files, which you can use to build your site.

The advantage of using the php set of files is that you can easily update the menu, footer, header etc by just updating the appropriate files in the "includes" folder. One change in a single file, and the updates will be reflected across your entire site.

If you absolutely need the file extensions to be *.html however, then you can use the files in the "build-files_HTML" folder.
